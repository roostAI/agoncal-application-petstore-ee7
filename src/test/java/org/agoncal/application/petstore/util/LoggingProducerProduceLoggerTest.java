================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper Logging Data Leakage
Issue: Exposing too much information through logging can lead to information leakage. Attackers could use detailed logs to gain insights into the application's behavior, underlying technologies, or even discover sensitive data.
Solution: Do not log sensitive information. Ensure that logging configuration allows for log level adjustments and consider using masking or tokenization for sensitive data. Set up proper log management policies.

Vulnerability: Injection Point environmental awareness
Issue: InjectionPoint is used to produce loggers dynamically, which may reveal internal class structures if not handled correctly. If an attacker has access to these logs, they could use the information to mount further attacks.
Solution: Restrict access to logs, use security annotations to control which users can access InjectionPoint metadata, and ensure that only sanitized data is included in logs.

Vulnerability: Unrestricted Access to Logs
Issue: If the logs are not properly protected, unauthorized users might access them. This could lead to exposure of application usage patterns, configurations, or user data.
Solution: Implement access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to the application logs. Log files should also be stored securely, with encryption at rest if necessary.

Vulnerability: Missing Log Sanitization
Issue: Unsanitized logs can contain user input or sensitive system information, which could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks or data leaks.
Solution: Ensure that log entries are stripped of sensitive information, and potentially harmful content is encoded or removed entirely before logging.

Vulnerability: Logger Spoofing
Issue: The logger name is dynamically determined by the class of the injection point, which could potentially be manipulated if input validation is not enforced, leading to misleading log entries.
Solution: Validate the class name before using it to get the Logger instance. Also, ensure that the environment does not allow arbitrary classes to be injected without proper checks.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful Logger Creation With Valid Injection Point

Details:  
  TestName: loggerCreationWithValidInjectionPoint
  Description: The test verifies that the Logger is successfully created with the correct name derived from a valid Injection Point.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock an InjectionPoint object that has a valid Member with a declaring class. 
  Act: Invoke the produceLogger method with the mocked InjectionPoint.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Logger has a name that matches the InjectionPoint's declaring class name.
Validation: 
  The assertion confirms that the Logger is correctly instantiated with the class name that is supposed to be logged. This ensures that the correct contextual logging information is associated with the logger.

Scenario 2: Handling Null InjectionPoint

Details:  
  TestName: loggerCreationWithNullInjectionPoint
  Description: The test ensures that the produceLogger method handles a null InjectionPoint gracefully, perhaps by throwing a specific exception or returning a default logger.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a null InjectionPoint object.
  Act: Invoke the produceLogger method with the null InjectionPoint.
  Assert: Assert that an appropriate exception is thrown or a default logger is returned.
Validation: 
  Checking the handling of null InjectionPoint is vital because dereferencing a null object in the method would lead to a NullPointerException, which signifies a flaw in the method's robustness and error handling.

Scenario 3: InjectionPoint With Null Member

Details:  
  TestName: loggerCreationWithNullMember
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the produceLogger method when the provided InjectionPoint's Member is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock an InjectionPoint with a null Member.
  Act: Invoke the produceLogger method with this InjectionPoint.
  Assert: Assert that an appropriate exception is thrown or a default logger is returned.
Validation: 
  It's important to validate the behavior in the case of a null Member to ensure the method provides a clear and predictable way to handle such situations, which might be encountered during runtime due to misconfigurations.

Scenario 4: InjectionPoint With Member Having Null Declaring Class

Details:  
  TestName: loggerCreationWithMemberHavingNullDeclaringClass
  Description: This test assesses how the produceLogger method reacts when the Member from the InjectionPoint has a null declaring class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock an InjectionPoint with a Member that has a null declaring class.
  Act: Invoke the produceLogger method with this InjectionPoint.
  Assert: Assert that an appropriate exception is thrown or a default logger is returned.
Validation: 
  This test is key for preventing situations where the logger could be created with an invalid or null name, which would be problematic for downstream logging operations.

Scenario 5: InjectionPoint With Anonymous Inner Class Member

Details:  
  TestName: loggerCreationWithAnonymousInnerClassMember
  Description: This scenario tests the produceLogger method with an InjectionPoint where the Member is an anonymous inner class, which might not have a canonical name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock an InjectionPoint with a Member that is an anonymous inner class.
  Act: Invoke the produceLogger method with this InjectionPoint.
  Assert: Assert that the returned Logger has an appropriate name, potentially defaulting to the parent class name.
Validation: 
  Anonymous inner classes represent an edge case that could potentially trip up the logger naming strategy. This test ensures compatibility with such cases and the resiliency of the produceLogger method.
