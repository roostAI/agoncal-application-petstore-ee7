================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-470: Unrestricted Direct Object References
Issue: The method 'produceConfigProperty' directly uses the value of InjectionPoint as key to retrieve properties. This might raise security concerns as it could potentially allow unauthorized access to configuration properties by injecting unwanted values.
Solution: Consider replacing direct object references with user-specific or session-specific object references which are mapped server-side to actual values. Also consider implementing access controls, like User Access Control (UAC), to validate user's permissions before accessing data.

Vulnerability: CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt
Issue: There are currently no measures in place to protect the properties data. Although not visible in the code snippet provided, if sensitive properties like passwords, API keys, or database connection details are included in the properties, they might be at risk.
Solution: Use a strong encryption algorithm combined with a unique salt for each value saved in the properties. Also, ensure encrypted values are securely handled and do not expose in logging statement or error messages.

Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: Since it's configuration related code, unique identifiers or tokens generated might not be random enough which could be guessed by an attacker. However, this is an assumption and cannot be confirmed with the given code snippet.
Solution: Always use secure library functions for generating random values, ensure the random generators are properly seeded and use sufficient length to prevent attackers from guessing them.

================================================================================
1. Scenario: Validate if the method "produceConfigProperty" successfully retrieves the property value from the Configuration for a given key.
2. Scenario: Validate if the method "produceConfigProperty" returns null in case the given key does not exist in the Configuration.
3. Scenario: Validate if the method "produceConfigProperty" throws NullPointerException when the passed InjectionPoint parameter is null.
4. Scenario: Validate if the method "produceConfigProperty" properly handles null keys, i.e., the key derived from `ip.getAnnotated().getAnnotation(ConfigProperty.class).value()` is null.
5. Scenario: Validate if the method "produceConfigProperty" properly handles empty keys, i.e., the key derived from `ip.getAnnotated().getAnnotation(ConfigProperty.class).value()` is an empty string.
6. Scenario: Validate the method's behaviour when the configuration properties (`props`) returns null when getting a property with the derived key.
7. Scenario: Validate if the method "produceConfigProperty" throws an exception when Annotated or/and Annotation are not accessible/available from InjectionPoint.
8. Scenario: Validate if the method "produceConfigProperty" works correctly with different types of configurations (example: different property sources like XML, JSON or YAML files).
9. Scenario: Perform stress testing by passing huge number of unique keys and checking the performance and stability of the "produceConfigProperty" method.
10. Scenario: Validate if the method "produceConfigProperty" works correctly when it is invoked concurrently from different threads. This scenario is important if the application is expected to be used in a multithreaded environment.
