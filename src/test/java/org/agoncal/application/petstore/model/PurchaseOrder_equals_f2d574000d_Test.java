================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Potential Null Pointer Exception
Issue: The code accesses properties of an object that could potentially be null, which might lead to a Null Pointer Exception: orderDate and customer. Null Pointer Exceptions can sometimes lead to issues such as program crashes, which could potentially be exploited in certain conditions.
Solution: Add null check validations prior to accessing properties of these objects. This helps to avoid Null Pointer Exceptions.

Vulnerability: Bad Practice: Reliance on Default Implementation of hashCode
Issue: Whenever equals() is overridden, it's recommended to also override hashCode(). Failing to do so may lead to inconsistent behaviour when objects are stored in collections dependent on these methods.
Solution: Override the hashCode() method so that it's consistent with the equals() method.

================================================================================
1. 'Equals' Scenario with Same Object: Test where, the same instance of the 'PurchaseOrder' object is passed in the 'equals' method. The expected result of the 'equals' method in this case is true.

2. 'Equals' Scenario with Different Object Type: Test where, another type of object is passed on argument in the 'equals' method. The expected result of the 'equals' method in this case is false.

3. 'Equals' Scenario with Null Object: Test where, a null object is passed in the 'equals' method. The expected result of the 'equals' method in this case is false.

4. 'Equals' Scenario with Different Order Date: Test where, another instance of the 'PurchaseOrder' object is passed with a different 'orderDate' in the 'equals' method. The expected result of the 'equals' method in this case is false.

5. 'Equals' Scenario with Different Customer: Test where, another instance of the 'PurchaseOrder' object is passed with a different 'customer' in the 'equals' method. The expected result of the 'equals' method in this case is false.

6. 'Equals' Scenario with Same Order Date and Customer: Test where, another instance of the 'PurchaseOrder' object is passed with the same 'orderDate' and 'customer' in the 'equals' method. The expected result of the 'equals' method in this case is true.

7. 'Equals' Scenario with Same Class but Different Attributes: Test where, an instance of the 'PurchaseOrder' object with a similar class type but different attributes is passed to the 'equals' method. The expected result is false.

8. 'Equals' Scenario with Same Attributes but Different Class: Test where, an instance of a different class object with similar attributes is passed to the 'equals' method. The expected result is false.

9. 'Equals' Method Overriding Validity: Test to validate the correct overriding of the 'equals' method in the 'PurchaseOrder' class. The expected result is that the 'equals' method of the 'Object' class should be successfully overridden.

10. 'Equals' Scenario with Different Instances: Test where, different instances of 'PurchaseOrder' objects with the same 'orderDate' and 'customer' are passed. The expected result is that the 'equals' method should return true, despite them being different instances with the same data.
