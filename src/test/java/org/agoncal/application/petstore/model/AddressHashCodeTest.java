================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-497: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
Issue: The hashCode method in the code snippet may expose sensitive information such as street address and zip code which can be accessed if the hashCode is logged or intercepted.
Solution: Avoid including sensitive personal information in the hashCode computation or use a secure hash function with a salt to prevent reverse-engineering of the values.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not show input validation before using the values in the hashCode method. If the input is controlled by the end-user, it might be possible to inject malicious input that affects the logic of the hashCode or causes other unintended side effects.
Solution: Ensure that validation on the input of 'street1', 'city', and 'zipcode' is conducted before using them in the hashCode method to prevent potential attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: Without proper validation, the embedded fields like street1, city, and zipcode might be concatenated into SQL queries leading to SQL injection if they contain malicious inputs.
Solution: Use Prepared Statements (parameterized queries) with proper escaping of the input parameters or ORM entity managers that automatically handle parameter bindings.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Exposing street1, city, and zip code information through methods like hashCode can leak information that might be used for social engineering or other malicious purposes.
Solution: Handle hashCode and equals with care by not exposing private and sensitive data. Alternatively, ensure data output does not reach unauthorized users.

Vulnerability: CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
Issue: The snippet includes 'javax.persistence.ManyToOne;' which typically relates to database entity relationships. If this relationship involves sensitive data without adequate protection, it could lead to exposure of credentials or private information.
Solution: Use encryption for sensitive data and proper access controls to ensure that only authorized systems and personnel can access the relationships involving sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
Issue: No mention of encryption or encoding when dealing with sensitive information like addresses suggests the possibility of sensitive data being stored or transmitted in clear text.
Solution: Implement encryption when storing or transmitting sensitive data, and ensure the use of strong, industry-standard encryption algorithms like AES or RSA.

Vulnerability: CWE-603: Use of Client-Side Authentication
Issue: Dependencies on client-side validation (e.g., JSR-303 annotations for validation like @NotNull, @Size) can be bypassed, and should not be the only line of defense.
Solution: Perform server-side validation in addition to any client-side checks to create a more secure application since the server environment is under the control of the application.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid Object HashCode Calculation

Details:
  TestName: calculateValidObjectHashCode
  Description: This test verifies that the hashCode() method computes the hash code correctly for a valid object with non-null street1, city, and zipcode fields.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the object with specific values for street1, city, and zipcode.
  Act: Call the hashCode() method on the instantiated object to calculate the hash code.
  Assert: Assert that the actual hash code matches the expected hash code computed manually or by an independent means.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies the consistency of the hashCode computation. It is important because the hashCode method needs to return consistent results for the same object state as per the contract of the hashCode method used in hash-based collections like HashSet and HashMap.

Scenario 2: HashCode With Null Fields

Details:
  TestName: calculateHashCodeWithNullFields
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the hashCode() method when some or all the fields (street1, city, zipcode) are null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the object with null values assigned to the street1, city, and/or zipcode fields.
  Act: Call the hashCode() method on the object.
  Assert: Verify that the method returns a hash code without throwing a NullPointerException.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the Objects.hash() method handles null values gracefully, as it should not throw an exception when calculating the hash code for an object with null fields. This is crucial to avoiding runtime errors in collections when encountered with objects containing null field values.

Scenario 3: Consistent HashCode For Same Object State

Details:
  TestName: consistencyOfHashCodeForSameObjectState
  Description: This test ensures the hashCode() method consistently returns the same hash code for objects with identical field values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two separate instances of the object with the same values for street1, city, and zipcode.
  Act: Call the hashCode() method on both instances to calculate their hash codes.
  Assert: Assert that both objects' hash codes are equal.
Validation:
  Since the hashCode() method must consistently return the same value for multiple invocations with an unaltered object state, this assertion confirms that property. This property is essential for the correct functioning of hash-based collections.

Scenario 4: Different HashCode For Different Object States

Details:
  TestName: differentHashCodeForDifferentObjectStates
  Description: This test checks that the hashCode() method returns different hash codes for objects with different field values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the object with different values for at least one of the fields: street1, city, or zipcode.
  Act: Call the hashCode() method on both objects to calculate their hash codes.
  Assert: Assert that the two hash codes are not equal.
Validation:
  This assertion ensures that different objects (with different states) generate different hash codes, which is fundamental for the hash-based collection's performance in distributing the objects across different buckets, reducing collision chances.

Scenario 5: HashCode For Empty Field Values

Details:
  TestName: calculateHashCodeForEmptyFieldValues
  Description: This test ensures that the hashCode() method can handle empty string values for street1, city, and zipcode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instances of the object with empty strings for street1, city, and zipcode.
  Act: Call the hashCode() method to calculate the hash code.
  Assert: Verify that a valid hash code is returned and not an exception is thrown.
Validation:
  This test is significant because it confirms that the Objects.hash() method behaves as expected when dealing with empty strings, which could be a common case if fields are optional or in the early stages of object construction.
