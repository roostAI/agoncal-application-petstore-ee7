================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or CWE-639
Issue: The equals method directly compares the fields of the object without any form of access control. This can potentially lead to unauthorized access or modification of sensitive data.
Solution: Implement proper access control checks before comparing object fields. Consider using Java Security Manager for fine-grained access control.

Vulnerability: Null Pointer Dereference or CWE-476
Issue: The equals method assumes that the fields 'street1', 'city', and 'zipcode' of the 'address' object are not null. If they are null, a NullPointerException will be thrown, potentially causing the program to crash.
Solution: Add null checks for these fields before comparing them. The Objects.equals() method is null-safe and can be used for this purpose.

Vulnerability: Inconsistent Equals and Hashcode or CWE-581
Issue: The provided code only shows an equals method. If a corresponding hashCode method that is consistent with this equals method is not implemented, it can lead to unexpected behavior when using collections that rely on these methods, such as HashSet or HashMap.
Solution: Always override hashCode when equals is overridden, and ensure that their contracts are consistent with each other.

================================================================================
"""
  Scenario 1: Test for a positive scenario where two objects are exactly the same.

  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualsWithSameObject.
    Description: This test will check if the equals method returns true when the same object is compared with itself. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object and assign it to two different references.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on one reference, passing the other as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the result is true.
  Validation: 
    The equals method should return true when the same object is compared with itself. This test verifies the reflexivity property of the equals method.

  Scenario 2: Test for a positive scenario where two different objects have the same values.

  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentObjectsSameValues.
    Description: This test will check if the equals method returns true when two different objects have the same values. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two different Address objects with the same values for street1, city, and zipcode.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on one object, passing the other as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the result is true.
  Validation: 
    The equals method should return true when two different objects have the same values. This tests the symmetric property of the equals method.

  Scenario 3: Test for a negative scenario where the compared object is null.

  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualsWithNullObject.
    Description: This test will check if the equals method returns false when the compared object is null. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on this object, passing null as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the result is false.
  Validation: 
    The equals method should return false when the compared object is null. This test ensures that the method handles null values correctly.

  Scenario 4: Test for a negative scenario where the compared object is of a different class.

  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentClassObject.
    Description: This test will check if the equals method returns false when the compared object is of a different class. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Address object and an object of a different class.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on the Address object, passing the object of a different class as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the result is false.
  Validation: 
    The equals method should return false when the compared object is of a different class. This test ensures that the method checks the class of the compared object.

  Scenario 5: Test for a negative scenario where the compared object has different values.

  Details:  
    TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentValuesObject.
    Description: This test will check if the equals method returns false when the compared object has different values for street1, city, and zipcode. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Address objects with different values for street1, city, and zipcode.
    Act: Invoke the equals method on one object, passing the other as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the result is false.
  Validation: 
    The equals method should return false when the compared object has different values. This test ensures that the method correctly compares the values of the objects.
