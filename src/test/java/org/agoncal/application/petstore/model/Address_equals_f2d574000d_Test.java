================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-595: Comparison Without Float Coercion
Issue: This vulnerability arises when an object is compared with another data object without appropriate coercion. The comparison can lead to unpredictable behavior due to floating point precision errors.
Solution: To resolve this vulnerability, implement a safe comparison operation by matching the classes before comparison, or coercing them to the appropriate type before the comparison.

Vulnerability: CWE-480: Use of Incorrect Operator
Issue: In the given code, equals() is used to compare class types. However, equals() in Java does not compare class types, but rather, compares the equality of object contents.
Solution: To fix this issue, use the instanceof operator or getClass() to compare class types. Ensure that you override equals() and hashCode() method whenever necessary for proper comparison.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: If the variables 'street1', 'city', or 'zipcode' are null, then calling equals() on them will throw a NullPointerException, leading to a possible system crash, or unexpected behavior.
Solution: To mitigate this, always perform a null check before calling methods on objects that could potentially be null.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The equals() method as implemented may inadvertently leak information about the string being compared, leading to potential sensitive data exposure.
Solution: A mitigation strategy is to use secure comparison that doesnâ€™t leak length information or details about the characters in the string. For this, consider using MessageDigest.isEqual() to compare strings.

================================================================================
Test Scenarios:

1. Test whether 'equals' method returns true when two address objects are same.
2. Test whether 'equals' method returns false when an address object is compared with null.
3. Test whether 'equals' method returns false when an address object is compared with an object from another class.
4. Test whether 'equals' method returns true when two address objects have the same 'street1', 'city', and 'zipcode' values.
5. Test whether 'equals' method returns false when two address objects have different 'street1', 'city', or 'zipcode' values.
6. Test whether 'equals' method returns false when one address object has null in 'street1', 'city', or 'zipcode' and other address object has valid non-null values.
7. Test whether 'equals' method returns true when two address objects have null in 'street1', 'city', or 'zipcode'.
8. Test the performance of 'equals' method in scenario of dealing with large number of complex address objects.
9. Test the behavior of 'equals' method when it's invoked from different threads, checking for thread-safety.
10. Test 'equals' method with different case values in 'street1', 'city', 'zipcode', and see if it treats "ABC Street" and "abc street" as equal or not.
11. Test 'equals' method to check behavior with leading or trailing white spaces in 'street1', 'city', and 'zipcode'.
