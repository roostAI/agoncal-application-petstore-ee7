/*
1. Test Scenario: Check the equals method when both objects contain identical data. 
   - Description: In this scenario, two Address objects are created with the same street1, city and zipcode values. When the equals method is called to compare these two objects, it should return true as both objects are identical based on street1, city and zipcode.

2. Test Scenario: Check the equals method when both objects contain different data.
   - Description: This test case creates two Address objects with different street1, city and zipcode values. The equals method is expected to return false in this scenario as both objects are different.

3. Test Scenario: Check the equals method when one of the object is null.
   - Description: In this scenario, the equals method is applied on a valid address object and null is passed as input. The method should return false as the object is not equals to null.

4. Test scenario: Check the equals method when objects are of different classes.
   - Description: Create an instance of another class different from Address. When the equals method is called to compare this instance with an Address instance, it should return false as objects of different types are not considered equal.

5. Test Scenario: Check the equals method with same object reference.
   - Description: In this scenario, the equals method is called on an address object and the same object is passed as the parameter. The method should return true as it is the same object.

6. Test Scenario: Check equals method when one of the key fields (street1, city, zipcode) is different within the two objects.
   - Description: In this scenario, two Address objects are created having identical data for street1 and city but different data for zipcode. The equals method should return false as the objects are not equivalent due to different zipcode.
   
7. Test Scenario: Check equals method when one of the fields in address object is null 
   - Description: Create two address objects, one with all fields populated and another with one field as null. equals method should return false. 

8. Test Scenario: Validate equals method by comparing two objects with null values in one of the fields.
   - Description: Two Address objects are created where both have identical values for city and zipcode, but null value for street1. equals method should return true as both objects have the same values for the key fields.
