================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-476: null pointer dereference
Issue: The equals method of the Product class may throw a NullPointerException if either name or description of the current object is null.
Solution: Add null checks for fields that are being accessed in the equals method.

Vulnerability: CWE-597: Incorrect comparison
Issue: The equals method of the Product class only compares name and description. If there are other fields in the Product class, two different products may be considered equal.
Solution: Consider all relevant fields in the equals method.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Test equals method with identical objects

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsWithIdenticalObjects
  Description: This test is to check the equals method when we pass an identical object as the parameter. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object and pass the same object as the parameter to the equals method.
  Act: Invoke the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation: 
  The equals method should return true when we pass the same object as the parameter. This is because the object is identical to itself.

Scenario 2: Test equals method with null object

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsWithNullObject
  Description: This test is to check the equals method when we pass null as the parameter. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object and pass null as the parameter to the equals method.
  Act: Invoke the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation: 
  The equals method should return false when we pass null as the parameter. This is because null is not equivalent to any object.

Scenario 3: Test equals method with different class objects

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentClassObjects
  Description: This test is to check the equals method when we pass an object of a different class as the parameter. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object and an object of a different class. Pass the different class object as the parameter to the equals method.
  Act: Invoke the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation: 
  The equals method should return false when we pass an object of a different class as the parameter. This is because objects of different classes cannot be equal.

Scenario 4: Test equals method with objects having different data

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsWithObjectsHavingDifferentData
  Description: This test is to check the equals method when we pass an object with different data as the parameter. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Product objects with different data. Pass one of the objects as the parameter to the equals method of the other.
  Act: Invoke the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation: 
  The equals method should return false when we pass an object with different data as the parameter. This is because two objects with different data cannot be equal.

Scenario 5: Test equals method with objects having same data

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsWithObjectsHavingSameData
  Description: This test is to check the equals method when we pass an object with the same data as the parameter. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Product objects with the same data. Pass one of the objects as the parameter to the equals method of the other.
  Act: Invoke the equals method.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation: 
  The equals method should return true when we pass an object with the same data as the parameter. This is because two objects with the same data should be considered equal.
