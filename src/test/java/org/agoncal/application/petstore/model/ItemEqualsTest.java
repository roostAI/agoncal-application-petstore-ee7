================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-597: Use of Wrong Operator in String Comparison
Issue: In Java, using '==' or '!=' for string comparison can lead to unexpected results because these operators compare object references, not their values. In the equals method, '==' is used which might lead to bugs.
Solution: Use the equals() method for string comparisons instead of '==' or '!='. The equals() method compares the content of the strings.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The equals method does not check if name or description fields are null before calling their equals method. This can potentially lead to a NullPointerException.
Solution: Add null checks for the fields before calling the equals method. Consider using Objects.equals() method which is null-safe.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the equals method returns true when compared with the same object.

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsWithSameObject.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method returns true when an object is compared with itself. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Item class.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, passing the same instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the result is true.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies the same instance as equal. This is significant in the context of application behavior, as it ensures correct identification of identical objects.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the equals method returns false when compared with a null object.

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsWithNullObject.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method returns false when an object is compared with a null object. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Item class.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, passing null as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the result is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies a null object as not equal. This is significant in the context of application behavior, as it prevents NullPointerExceptions.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the equals method returns false when compared with an object of a different class.

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentClassObject.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method returns false when an object is compared with an object of a different class. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Item class and an instance of a different class.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on the Item instance, passing the different class instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the result is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies objects of different classes as not equal. This is significant in the context of application behavior, as it ensures correct identification of non-identical objects.

Scenario 4: Test to check if the equals method returns false when compared with an Item object with different values.

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsWithDifferentValuesItem.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method returns false when an Item object is compared with another Item object with different values. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the Item class with different values.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on one Item instance, passing the other Item instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the result is false.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies Item objects with different values as not equal. This is significant in the context of application behavior, as it ensures correct identification of non-identical objects.

Scenario 5: Test to check if the equals method returns true when compared with an Item object with the same values.

Details:  
  TestName: testEqualsWithSameValuesItem.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method returns true when an Item object is compared with another Item object with the same values. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the Item class with the same values.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on one Item instance, passing the other Item instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the result is true.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the equals method correctly identifies Item objects with the same values as equal. This is significant in the context of application behavior, as it ensures correct identification of identical objects.
