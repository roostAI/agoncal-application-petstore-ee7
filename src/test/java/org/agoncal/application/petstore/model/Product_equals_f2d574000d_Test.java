================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-203: Information Exposure Through Discrepancy
Issue: The 'equals()' method compares sensitive data fields which may expose it to the risk of Timing Attacks. A timing attack is a side channel attack where an attacker can determine the equality of two elements by measuring the time it takes for the 'equals()' method to return a result.
Solution: It is recommended to use a constant time comparison method when comparing sensitive data to prevent Timing Attacks. Java's 'MessageDigest.isEqual()' could be used as it computes its equality check in constant time.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Both products have the same name and description
Given two products with the same name and description
When the equals() function is called
Then it should return true, as they are considered to be equal according to the provided business logic 

Scenario 2: Both products have different names but the same description
Given two products with different names but the same description
When the equals() function is called
Then it should return false, as the names of the products are different

Scenario 3: Both products have the same name but different descriptions
Given two products with the same name but different descriptions
When the equals() function is called
Then it should return false, as the descriptions are different

Scenario 4: Both products have different names and descriptions
Given two products with different names and descriptions
When the equals() function is called
Then it should return false, as both the name and description are different

Scenario 5: The object passed is null
Given a null object
When the equals() function is called
Then it should return false, as null cannot be equal to an existing object

Scenario 6: The object passed is not of Product class
Given an object which is not of the Product class
When the equals() function is called
Then it should return false, because the object is not of the same class as the current object

Scenario 7: The object being compared is the same instance as the current object
Given the same instance of the product
When the equals() function is called
Then it should return true, as an object is always equal to itself.
