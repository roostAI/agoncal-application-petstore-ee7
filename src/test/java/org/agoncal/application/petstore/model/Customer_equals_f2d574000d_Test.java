================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-297: Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch
Issue: Improper validation of SSL/TLS certificates can lead to a man-in-the-middle attack. Without certificate validation, an attacker could potentially intercept and modify the communication between the client and the server.
Solution: Ensure proper validation of SSL/TLS certificates against a trusted certificate authority (CA). This can involve hostname verification, certificate chain validation, and date expiration checks.

Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: The code may be vulnerable to attacks if it deserializes untrusted data without validation, leading to remote code execution or other exploits.
Solution: Avoid deserialization of data from untrusted sources. If deserialization is necessary, implement strict type checking and input validation. Also, consider using safer serialization formats like JSON or XML with proper sanitization.

Vulnerability: CWE-320: Key Management Errors
Issue: Management of cryptographic keys is complex and errors can lead to data leakage. Storing keys in source code, config files, or transmitting them insecurely are common mistakes.
Solution: Use secure storage for keys, such as hardware security modules or secure vaults. Only transfer keys over secure channels with appropriate encryption.

Vulnerability: CWE-609: Double-Checked Locking
Issue: The usage of Double-Checked Locking pattern for lazy initialization of instances can lead to incorrect behavior in a multi-threaded context due to memory model issues.
Solution: Avoid Double-Checked Locking pattern. Instead, use static initializers or enum types to implement Singleton safely, or employ the Initialization-on-demand holder idiom.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: SQL queries that include user-supplied input without proper sanitization can be manipulated to alter the query, leading to unauthorized data exposure or database modification.
Solution: Use prepared statements with parameterized queries, employ proper input validation and sanitization, and follow the principle of least privilege when granting database permissions.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
Issue: Java applications that dynamically generate web content without proper output encoding can be vulnerable to XSS, where attackers inject malicious scripts.
Solution: Encode all user-supplied output before displaying it in a browser. Use context-aware encoding libraries and Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to reduce XSS risks.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Objects Are The Same

Details:  
  TestName: objectsAreTheSame
  Description: This test checks whether the equals method returns true when the same object is passed as a parameter to itself.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Customer class and store it in a reference variable.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on this instance, passing itself as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is `true`.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the equals method can correctly identify that an object is equal to itself, which is an important aspect of the equality contract and reflexive property.

Scenario 2: Object Is Compared With Null

Details:  
  TestName: objectComparedWithNull
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns false when a null reference is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Customer class.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on this instance, passing `null` as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is `false`.
Validation: 
  The test confirms that the equals method can handle null references correctly, which is important to prevent `NullPointerException` and maintain robustness.

Scenario 3: Objects Have Different Classes

Details:  
  TestName: objectsHaveDifferentClasses
  Description: This test verifies that the equals method returns false when an object of a different class is passed as an argument.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Customer class and an instance of another class, such as `String`.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on the Customer instance, passing the String instance as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is `false`.
Validation: 
  The test ensures that the equals method respects the symmetry property and does not consider objects of different types as equal.

Scenario 4: Objects Have Different Logins

Details:  
  TestName: objectsHaveDifferentLogins
  Description: This test checks that the equals method returns false when another Customer object with a different login is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different instances of the Customer class with different `login` values.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on the first instance, passing the second instance as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is `false`.
Validation: 
  This test validates that the equals method correctly assesses equality based on the login field, confirming attribute-specific comparison integrity.

Scenario 5: Objects Have Same Logins

Details:  
  TestName: objectsHaveSameLogins
  Description: This test checks that the equals method returns true when another Customer object with the same login is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the Customer class with the same `login` values.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on the first instance, passing the second instance as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is `true`.
Validation: 
  This test confirms that the equals method evaluates the login property correctly to determine object equality, which is essential for business logic that relies on the uniqueness of customer logins.

Scenario 6: Object Passed Is A Proxy Of The Class

Details:  
  TestName: objectPassedIsAProxy
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns false when a proxy instance with the same data is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Customer class and a dynamic proxy instance that implements the same interface and mimics the Customer behavior with identical login details.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on the Customer instance, passing the proxy instance as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is `false`.
Validation: 
  It is crucial to confirm that the equals method can discern between actual instances and proxy instances, as this may impact identity and behavior checks within an application.

Remember to replace the placeholder class `Customer` with the actual class if `Customer` is not the right one. The same applies to the placeholder property `login`.
