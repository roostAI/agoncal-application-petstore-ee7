ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashCode_5a2657087a

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Object Hashing (CWE-328)
Issue: The hashCode() method is using Objects.hash(), which is not cryptographically strong. This could potentially lead to collision attacks where two different inputs produce the same hash code.
Solution: Consider using a more secure hashing method that is resistant to collision attacks, such as SHA-256.

Vulnerability: Potential Data Leakage (CWE-200)
Issue: The hashCode() method is public, which potentially exposes internal data structure (name, description). If these fields carry sensitive data, this could lead to information leakage.
Solution: Make sure the fields 'name' and 'description' do not carry sensitive data. If they do, consider modifying the visibility of the hashCode() method or avoid using sensitive data in the hash computation.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for valid hashCode generation
Details:  
  TestName: testValidHashCodeGeneration
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the hashCode method returns a valid hash code for the given name and description.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object with a known name and description.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the object.
  Assert: Compare the returned hash code with the hash code generated manually using the Objects.hash method.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the hashCode method correctly generates the hash code for an object. This is important for the proper functioning of hash-based collections and for the efficient retrieval of objects.

Scenario 2: Test for hashCode consistency
Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeConsistency
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the hashCode method returns the same hash code for the same object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object with a known name and description.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the object multiple times.
  Assert: Ensure that the returned hash code is the same for each invocation.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the hashCode method is consistent, i.e., it returns the same hash code for the same object. This is crucial for the correct operation of hash-based collections.

Scenario 3: Test for hashCode distinctness
Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeDistinctness
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the hashCode method returns different hash codes for different objects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two objects with different names and descriptions.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on both objects.
  Assert: Ensure that the returned hash codes are different.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the hashCode method correctly distinguishes between different objects. This is important for the proper operation of hash-based collections and for the efficient retrieval of objects.

Scenario 4: Test for hashCode null handling
Details:  
  TestName: testHashCodeNullHandling
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the hashCode method correctly handles null values for name and description.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object with null values for name and description.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method on the object.
  Assert: Ensure that the method does not throw a NullPointerException.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the hashCode method correctly handles null values. This is important for the robustness of the application, as null values may be encountered in practice.
