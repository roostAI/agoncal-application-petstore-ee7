================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-000: Insecure Library Usage
Issue: The use of insecure third-party libraries can introduce vulnerabilities into an application. Libraries like javax.persistence.* and javax.validation.* are often targeted.
Solution: Ensure that all third-party libraries used in the application are kept up-to-date and check for any known vulnerabilities in these libraries.

Vulnerability: CWE-000: Improper Input Validation
Issue: Without proper input validation, attackers can craft inputs in a way that can cause the application to behave in unexpected ways, leading to vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and remote code execution.
Solution: Use validation annotations like @NotNull, @Size, etc. on all fields that are accepting inputs from outside the application. This can help in ensuring that the inputs meet the required criteria before being processed by the application.

  Scenario 1: Test to Validate the Return Value of toString Method

  Details:  
    TestName: testToStringReturnValue
    Description: This test is meant to check the value returned by the toString method. It verifies that the method returns the correct name of the object. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object and assign a name to it.
    Act: Invoke the toString method on the object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against the expected name of the object.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the toString method returns the correct name of the object. The expected result is the name assigned to the object. This test is significant in the context of application behavior as it ensures that the toString method functions correctly and returns the expected name of an object.

  Scenario 2: Test to Validate the Return Value of toString Method when the Name is Null

  Details:  
    TestName: testToStringReturnValueWhenNameIsNull
    Description: This test is meant to check the value returned by the toString method when the name of the object is null. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object without assigning a name to it.
    Act: Invoke the toString method on the object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned value is null.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the toString method returns null when the name of the object is not assigned. This test is significant as it checks the behavior of the toString method when the name of the object is not defined.

  Scenario 3: Test to Validate the Return Value of toString Method when the Name is an Empty String

  Details:  
    TestName: testToStringReturnValueWhenNameIsEmpty
    Description: This test is meant to check the value returned by the toString method when the name of the object is an empty string. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an object and assign an empty string as its name.
    Act: Invoke the toString method on the object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned value is an empty string.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify that the toString method returns an empty string when the name of the object is an empty string. This test is significant as it checks the behavior of the toString method when the name of the object is an empty string.
