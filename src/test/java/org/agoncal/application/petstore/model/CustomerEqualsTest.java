ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=equals_f2d574000d

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Inconsistent equals method
Issue: The equals method in the Customer class only considers the 'login' attribute for equality. This could lead to logical errors if two different customers have the same login.
Solution: Consider adding more attributes to the equals method to ensure uniqueness. Additionally, always override hashCode when equals is overridden to maintain the general contract for the hashCode method, which states that equal objects must have equal hash codes.

"""
Scenario 1: Test when the object is the same
Details:  
  TestName: testWhenObjectIsSame
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the equals method when the object compared is the same instance. The expected result is true since the object is the same.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Customer object.
    Act: Invoke the equals method, passing the same Customer object as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the outcome is true.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies the same instance as equal. This is significant in the context of application behavior, as it ensures correct identification of objects.

Scenario 2: Test when the object is null
Details:  
  TestName: testWhenObjectIsNull
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the equals method when the object compared is null. The expected result is false since null is not equivalent to any object instance.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Customer object.
    Act: Invoke the equals method, passing null as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the outcome is false.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies null as not equal to any object instance. This is significant in the context of application behavior, as it prevents NullPointerExceptions.

Scenario 3: Test when the object is of a different class
Details:  
  TestName: testWhenObjectIsOfDifferentClass
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the equals method when the object compared is of a different class. The expected result is false since objects of different classes cannot be equal.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a Customer object and an object of a different class.
    Act: Invoke the equals method, passing the object of a different class as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the outcome is false.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies objects of different classes as not equal. This is significant in the context of application behavior, as it ensures correct identification of objects.

Scenario 4: Test when the object is a different Customer with a different login
Details:  
  TestName: testWhenObjectIsDifferentCustomerWithDifferentLogin
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the equals method when the object compared is a different Customer with a different login. The expected result is false since the logins are different.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Customer objects with different logins.
    Act: Invoke the equals method, passing the second Customer object as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the outcome is false.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies different Customer objects with different logins as not equal. This is significant in the context of application behavior, as it ensures correct identification of objects.

Scenario 5: Test when the object is a different Customer with the same login
Details:  
  TestName: testWhenObjectIsDifferentCustomerWithSameLogin
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the equals method when the object compared is a different Customer but with the same login. The expected result is true since the logins are the same.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Customer objects with the same login.
    Act: Invoke the equals method, passing the second Customer object as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the outcome is true.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies different Customer objects with the same login as equal. This is significant in the context of application behavior, as it ensures correct identification of objects.
