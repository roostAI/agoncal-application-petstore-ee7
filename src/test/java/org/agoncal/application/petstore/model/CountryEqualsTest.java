ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=equals_f2d574000d

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: NullPointerException
Issue: Invoking equals() on 'isoCode' may result in a NullPointerException if 'isoCode' is null.
Solution: Check if 'isoCode' is null before calling equals() or use Objects.equals() to avoid potential NullPointerException.

Vulnerability: Inconsistent Equals and HashCode
Issue: The absence of a hashCode() method that is consistent with equals() can lead to unexpected behavior when objects of this class are used in collections like HashMap or HashSet.
Solution: Always override hashCode() when overriding equals() to maintain the general contract for the hashCode() method, which states that equal objects must have equal hash codes.

Vulnerability: Missing Input Validation
Issue: The equals() method assumes 'isoCode' is a valid non-null value without checking, which could lead to equality checks with invalid country codes.
Solution: Implement input validation ensuring 'isoCode' adheres to expected format and is not null during object instantiation or mutation.

Vulnerability: Insecure Class Design
Issue: The code provided doesn't show the complete class definition. Depending on the rest of the implementation, mutable objects might be a source of security risks, especially if accessed concurrently.
Solution: Ensure the class is designed securely, with encapsulation, immutability where necessary, and thread-safe handling if used in a multi-threaded environment.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Objects are the same instance

Details:  
  TestName: objectsAreTheSameInstance
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies the two objects as the same instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Country class.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on the same instance.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that when the same object instance is passed to the equals method, it acknowledges that they are equal, as per the '==' identity check.
  The significance of this test is to confirm that the most basic case of equality (identity) is handled correctly by the method.

Scenario 2: Objects are Equal

Details:  
  TestName: objectsAreEqual
  Description: This test ensures the Country objects with the same isoCode values are considered equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two different instances of the Country class with the same isoCode.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on one instance and pass the other as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if two Country objects having identical isoCode values are correctly identified as equal by the equals method, which indicates proper functioning of the value comparison.
  This test is significant as it confirms that the primary business logic of object comparison based on the isoCode attribute works as expected.

Scenario 3: Objects are Not Equal

Details:  
  TestName: objectsAreNotEqual
  Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies that two Country objects with different isoCode values are not equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the Country class with different isoCode values.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on one instance and pass the other as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the equals method is performing a correct value-based comparison, ensuring that objects with different isoCodes are not treated as equal.
  This test is significant as it checks the correctness of the equals implementation in distinguishing objects based on their critical attribute value.

Scenario 4: Passed Object is Null

Details:  
  TestName: passedObjectIsNull
  Description: This test ensures that the equals method returns false when it's passed a null reference.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Country class.
  Act: Invoke the equals method on this instance with a null reference as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation: 
  This assertion checks the robustness of the equals method, ensuring it gracefully handles null references without throwing an exception, as the test expects a return value of false.
  This test confirms the method's reliability in handling potential null pointer conditions.

Scenario 5: Objects from Different Classes

Details:  
  TestName: objectsFromDifferentClasses
  Description: This test verifies that the equals method returns false for objects that do not share the same class as Country, even if they have a similar field structure or naming.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Country instance and an instance of another class (e.g., Object or a mock).
  Act: Invoke the equals method on the Country instance with the other object instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation: 
  This assertion confirms that class type is also considered in the equals method, which is in line with the `getClass() != o.getClass()` check. Objects of different classes should not be considered equal.
  The significance of this scenario ensures that the equals method does not make incorrect assumptions based on field names or structures between classes.
