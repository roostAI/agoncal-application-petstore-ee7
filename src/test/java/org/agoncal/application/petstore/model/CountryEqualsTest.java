================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-470: Unchecked Return Value to NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The unchecked return value issue occurs when the software does not check the return value from a method or function, which can allow adversaries to alter control flow, execute arbitrary code, or cause a system crash. In the provided code, the equals method does not check for null values, which can cause a NullPointerException.
Solution: Always check for null before calling a method on an object. In the equals method, before calling equals on isoCode, check if it is not null.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: Information can be exposed through query strings in the URL. This is not directly related to the provided code but is a common vulnerability in Java applications. If the isoCode is sensitive information, it should not be exposed in a GET request.
Solution: Do not expose sensitive information in the URL. Use POST requests to send sensitive information to the server.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Test for Same Object Reference

Details:  
  TestName: testSameObjectReference
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method correctly identifies that two references pointing to the same object are equal. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Country object and assign it to two different references. 
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing one reference as the parameter. 
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies that two references pointing to the same object are equal. This is significant in determining object equality based on reference.

Scenario 2: Test for Different Class Objects

Details:  
  TestName: testDifferentClassObjects
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method correctly identifies that an object of a different class is not equal to the Country object. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Country object and an object of a different class. 
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the different class object as the parameter. 
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies that an object of a different class is not equal to the Country object. This is important for ensuring object equality is class-specific.

Scenario 3: Test for Null Object

Details:  
  TestName: testNullObject
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method correctly identifies that a null object is not equal to the Country object. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Country object and a null reference. 
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing the null reference as the parameter. 
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies that a null object is not equal to the Country object. This is crucial for avoiding null pointer exceptions during object comparison.

Scenario 4: Test for Objects with Same ISO Code

Details:  
  TestName: testObjectsWithSameISOCode
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method correctly identifies that two Country objects with the same ISO code are equal. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Country objects with the same ISO code. 
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing one Country object as the parameter to the equals method of the other Country object. 
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns true.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies that two Country objects with the same ISO code are equal. This is vital in ensuring object equality based on the ISO code.

Scenario 5: Test for Objects with Different ISO Code

Details:  
  TestName: testObjectsWithDifferentISOCode
  Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method correctly identifies that two Country objects with different ISO codes are not equal. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Country objects with different ISO codes. 
  Act: Invoke the equals method by passing one Country object as the parameter to the equals method of the other Country object. 
  Assert: Assert that the equals method returns false.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the equals method correctly identifies that two Country objects with different ISO codes are not equal. This is essential in ensuring object equality is based on the ISO code.
