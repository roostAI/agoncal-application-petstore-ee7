================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-597: Use of Equals() Method on Incomparable Types
Issue: The equals() method is used to compare objects for equality. However, this method can only be used to compare objects that are instances of the same class. If an object of a different class is passed to the equals() method, a ClassCastException will be thrown, leading to potential denial of service.
Solution: To avoid this vulnerability, use the instanceof operator before casting the object in the equals() method. This will ensure that the object is an instance of the correct class before it is cast, preventing a ClassCastException.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: In the equals() method, there is a call to name.equals(category.name). If name is null, a NullPointerException will be thrown, leading to a potential crash of the application.
Solution: To mitigate this issue, always check if the object is null before calling any method on it. This can be done by adding a null check like this: if(name != null && name.equals(category.name)).

Vulnerability: CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
Issue: While not directly present in the submitted code, the equals() method often works in tandem with the hashCode() method. If the hashCode() method is not correctly implemented, it can lead to logical errors and potential security vulnerabilities, including incorrect type conversion.
Solution: Ensure that hashCode() is correctly implemented. The general contract of hashCode() is: whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once, it should consistently return the same integer, provided no information used in equals() comparisons on the object is modified.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Testing the equals() method when both objects are the same
TestName: testEqualsMethodWithSameObjects
Description: This test checks if the equals() method correctly identifies two identical objects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Category class.
  Act: Call the equals() method, passing the same instance as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation: 
  The equals() method should return true when the same object is compared with itself. This test validates the reflexive property of the equals() contract in Java.

Scenario 2: Testing the equals() method with two different objects of the same class
TestName: testEqualsMethodWithDifferentObjects
Description: This test checks if the equals() method correctly identifies two different objects of the same class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the Category class with different names.
  Act: Call the equals() method, passing one instance as a parameter to the equals() method of the other instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation: 
  The equals() method should return false when two different objects of the same class are compared. This test validates that the equals() method correctly identifies different objects.

Scenario 3: Testing the equals() method with null
TestName: testEqualsMethodWithNull
Description: This test checks if the equals() method correctly handles null values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Category class.
  Act: Call the equals() method, passing null as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation: 
  The equals() method should return false when the passed object is null. This test validates that the equals() method correctly handles null values.

Scenario 4: Testing the equals() method with an object of a different class
TestName: testEqualsMethodWithDifferentClass
Description: This test checks if the equals() method correctly identifies objects of different classes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Category class and another instance of a different class.
  Act: Call the equals() method, passing the instance of the different class as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the result is false.
Validation: 
  The equals() method should return false when an object of a different class is compared. This test validates that the equals() method correctly identifies objects of different classes.

Scenario 5: Testing the equals() method with two identical objects of the same class
TestName: testEqualsMethodWithIdenticalObjects
Description: This test checks if the equals() method correctly identifies two identical objects of the same class.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two instances of the Category class with the same name.
  Act: Call the equals() method, passing one instance as a parameter to the equals() method of the other instance.
  Assert: Assert that the result is true.
Validation: 
  The equals() method should return true when two identical objects of the same class are compared. This test validates that the equals() method correctly identifies identical objects.
